## Title: Improving Accuracy in Hindi to English Machine Translation with a Hybrid Approach

### Abstract
Machine Translation still remains a largely unsolved problem. Over the past few decades,
there have been many approaches to solve it. However, all of these approaches fall short on
the accuracy required to ‘precisely’ translate an arbitrary sentence. The work presented in this thesis report approaches the translation problem for
Hindi to English. There are only a few known attempts for the source to target direction
on this language pair. The most recent attempt has suggested a hybrid approach which is
also the focus of this thesis. The proposed system aims to improve the accuracy of Hindi to
English Machine Translation on long as well as short sentences. The hybrid method presented in this work is a corpus-guided approach. It
uses Statistical Machine Translation as a core component which is augmented by the
example-based and rule-based sub-systems. The end results demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves high standards of accuracy in translation of simple, compound as well as
complex sentences from Hindi to English.
